2. Login with your credentials
3. make a dir "mlpki"
4. move the tool zip archive to mlpki/mlpki.zip
5. unzip the tool
6. make the tool script executable 
	chmod u+x pki.sh

###### Best Practice and Troubleshooting ##########
If the certificates are not valid, corrupt by any reason, Clean up the tool:
Menu 96 --> Menu 9 (Cleanup.....)
This will delete all certificates and keys, but not the rootca. Now you can re-create all certificates with the current rootca from scratch.
